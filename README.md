# Session 4

## Qualean class

In this class, We can assign it only 3 possible real states. True, False, and Maybe (1, 0, -1) but it internally picks an imaginary state. The moment you assign it a real number, it immediately finds an imaginary number random.uniform(-1, 1) and multiplies with it and stores that number internally after using Bankers rounding to 10th decimal place. 

The class has the functions below:

## __and__
Calculates or consider our normal AND operator


## __or__

Calculates or consider our normal OR operator

## __repr__

Representation of the class

## __str__

Representation of the class when given string output

## __add__

Calculates or consider our normal + (plus) operator
## __eq__

Calculates or consider our normal == (equal) operator

## __ge__


Calculates or consider our normal "greater than or equal to" operator
## __gt__


Calculates or consider our normal "greater than" operator

## __invertsign__

Change sign of the class value to this opposite sign
## __le__

Calculates or consider our normal "less than or equal to" operator
## __lt__

Calculates or consider our normal "less than" operator

## __mul__

Calculates or consider our normal "multiplication" operator

## __sqrt__

Calculates square root of the class value
